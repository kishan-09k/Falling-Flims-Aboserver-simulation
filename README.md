## 📖 Project Overview

This project is an industrial-grade simulation of a **Falling Film Absorber**, specifically designed for the absorption of Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) gas into water to produce liquid Hydrochloric Acid. 

Unlike basic algebraic calculators, this application utilizes **Finite Difference Methods (Differential Modeling)** to evaluate heat and mass transfer phenomena dynamically along the axial length of graphite tubes. It provides a highly accurate, point-wise profile of temperature, concentration, and heat flux.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Differential Equation Solving:** The core engine slices the reactor tube into micro-segments to solve simultaneous heat and mass balance equations iteratively.
* **Transport Phenomena Integration:** Dynamically calculates fluid mechanics and heat transfer parameters such as the Reynolds Number for falling liquid films and local heat transfer coefficients.
* **Thermodynamic Rigor:** Accurately accounts for the highly exothermic heat of solution of HCl and calculates localized partial pressure driving forces.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A clean, modern UI built purely in Python using Streamlit.
* **Scientific Visualization:** Interactive, dual-axis plotting of temperature, concentration, and localized heat flux profiles using Plotly.

## 🧮 Core Mathematical Concept

The simulation evaluates the energy balance across a differential length (dz) of the tube:

$$\frac{dT}{dz} = \frac{Q_{gen} - Q_{removed}}{\dot{m} \cdot C_p}$$

Where $Q_{gen}$ is the heat generated by mass absorption and $Q_{removed}$ is the heat transferred to the cooling water jacket.
