# Advanced Falling Film Absorber Simulation

This project models the heat and mass transfer of Hydrogen Chloride (HCl) absorption into water using a falling film absorber with graphite tubes. The simulation uses finite difference methods to solve fundamental differential equations along the axial length of the reactor.

## Features
* **Differential Modeling:** Solves heat and mass balance at every 10cm slice of the tube.
* **Transport Phenomena:** Integrates real-time Reynolds number and heat transfer coefficients.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Built entirely with Python and Streamlit.
* **Scientific Visualizations:** Powered by Plotly.
